<p>Right now, Christians around the world are journeying through the season of Lent, which lasts 40 days (not counting Sundays), after which we celebrate Easter. The 40 days of Lent represent the 40 days that Jesus spent in the wilderness, fasting, praying, and overcoming the temptations of Satan. Sundays are not counted because each Sunday represents a "mini-Easter," where Christians anticipate celebrating the resurrection of Jesus, who defeated death and who gives all who trust in him hope, a future, and a new life that we could never achieve by ourselves.

<p>You may have heard people say they are going to "give something up," as in "I’m giving up coffee for Lent." You might wonder why anyone would want to do that. The idea is that when you stop doing something you're used to doing (like buying, making, and/or drinking coffee every day), you have more time to notice other things... more time to pay attention to your own life in relation to God. You can notice what good things are growing, what parts of your life need pruning, and where you need encouragement to keep following in the way of Jesus.
</p><br>

<p>Alongside those things, Christians notice the journey of Jesus to the cross. We notice more deeply Jesus' life, his choices, his way of relating to God, his manner of living and being with close friends and crowds, and his self-giving love (even to the point of death on a cross)</p><br>

<p>In noticing those things about Jesus, we notice aspects of our own lives... our journeys of pain and suffering... our failings. It may sound like a "downer" to take so much time to reflect on all those things. But, here's the hopeful thing: "Lent" is an old Anglo Saxon word meaning "spring," the season when new leaves grow, flowers blossom, and new life begins. So, even though it's cold outside right now, and it may appear that the leafless trees and plants are dead, we recognize during Lent that new life is possible.</p><br>

<p>While some Christians choose to give up something for Lent, others decide to add something to their lives, such as more time in prayer and Bible study, more intentional acts of kindness, more time face to face with friends (rather than on devices), more volunteering, more reaching out to forgive and receive forgiveness, more gratitude and contentment for the gifts we have already received. Whatever we give up or add to our lives in this season of Lent, may we notice God’s deep love for us in Jesus, turn away from the habits that devour us, and be changed by following the crucified and risen One.</p><br>
